Hikes will be in the immediate area and possibly others farther afield. After the days’ hikes, we will all return to the Conway Hostel (CoHo), our basecamp for the weekend. The trip includes three nights’ lodging at CoHo, where you will find all the comforts you are looking for after a long hike– shared bunk rooms, private bathrooms, a shared kitchen with full access, and shared space for socializing. A group dinner will be included and served on Saturday and Sunday evening, and CoHo offers free coffee, tea, and granola bars for breakfasts. Friday night dinner will be an optional potluck. Breakfast (other than what the hostel offers) and lunches not included. Evening activities will be offered, possibilities including a movie screening, star gazing, fire pit, and games. Cost is $210 for AMC members ($225 for non-members) per person for 3 nights at CoHo and 2 dinners.
